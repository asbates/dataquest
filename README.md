# About

This repository contains some of the work I've done for courses on 
  [Data Quest](https://github.com/asbates/dataquest.git).
Data Quest is an online platform for learning data related skills.
The projects in this repository are from the Data Engineering path.

I started this path to brush up on my Python skills, to learn about new things 
  like algorithms, and to level up my SQL skills.
The conent in this repository is based on Data Quest's guided projects.
The last module for some courses is a project where you get a chance to 
  implement what was learned in the course.
I've only included projects which contain new topics for me.
For example, I didn't do the project for the introduction to Python course 
  because I was already familiar with Python.
But I did do the project for introduction to algorithms because that was a new
  topic for me.

The projects here are written in Python using 
  [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
If you are coming from the Python world, this may seem a bit weird.
Why not use a Jupyter notebook?
Because I _love_ R Markdown.
I think it's absolutely fantastic, I use it almost every day, and I prefer it 
  to Jupyter notebooks.
Since R Markdown also supports 
  [more languages than R](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html),
  I can use it like I normally woud, just with Python instead of R.
You might also be wondering about the `.Rproj` file.
The reason for that is simlar to R Markdown.
I'm using [R Studio](https://rstudio.com) because it's what I'm familiar with.

Since I'm taking Data Engineering courses, there is of course data associated
  with the projects.
I'm using these files locally so they are not in this repository.
Unfortunately that means the files here can not be downloaded and run without
  a bit of prep work.
But I will try to provide links to the source data so you can access them if
  you choose.
