# Introduction

This project applies topics learned in an introduction to algorithms course to
  querying a csv file.
The idea is that we are an online laptop retailer and we want to answer some
  questions about our inventory.
For example, identifying laptops that fit within a given budget.
We start by creating a simple class to represent our inventory (the csv file) 
  that holds basic information like the number of laptops in the inventory.
From there, we build upon this class by adding methods to, for example, get
  information about a particular laptop from it's ID number.
We then improve on these methods by using what was learned in the course to
  speed things up.

# Data

The data for this project is a modified version of the 
  [Laptop Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/laptop-prices) data set on 
  Kaggle.
It contains price (obviously) in Euros, along with other information such as 
  size and memory, for 1,300 laptops.
Each laptop was given an ID number (e.g. 123456), instead of using the row 
  number as supplied on Kaggle and the prices were rounded to whole numbers.

```{python first-look, eval = FALSE}
import csv

with open('laptops.csv') as file:
    read_file = list(csv.reader(file))
    header = read_file[0]
    rows = read_file[0:]
    
print(header)
print(rows[1:6])
```

# A First Class

We start with a simple class called `Inventory` that represents our inventory.
Upon initialization, the `Inventory` class will read in the csv file (the
  inventory), do a little pre-processing, and store some information about the 
  file.
We can then test the class by creating a new instance and checking that the
  header attribute is correct and the rows attribute has the correct number
  of rows.

```{python}
import csv

class Inventory():
    
    def __init__(self, csv_filename):
        with open(csv_filename) as file:
            read_file = list(csv.reader(file))
            # convert price to an integer
            for row in read_file[1:]:
                row[12] = int(row[12])
            
            self.header = read_file[0]
            self.rows = read_file[1:]
            
# try it out
new_inventory = Inventory('laptops.csv')
print(new_inventory.header)
print(len(new_inventory.rows))
```

Everything looks good here.
